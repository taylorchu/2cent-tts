# 2cent-tts

This experiment aims to develop an open-weight, cost-effective speech model using just a few hundred hours of synthetic training data. After training, the model is converted to be compatible with [piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper.git) for inference purposes.

Currently, the system only supports US English, though support for additional languages is planned for future releases.
